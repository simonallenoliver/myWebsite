                            into strange concepts; that’s how I ended up here. After working in sports wagering regulation and
                            compliance for a little over three years, I decided to make a big change and pursue a field that I
                            knew would nurture my curiosity and desire to solve problems with creative solutions. As a full stack
                            developer, I’ve acquainted myself with a hefty list of tools I’ve used to tackle problems head on -
                            but more importantly, I’ve sharpened my abilities to quickly pick up new tools and adapt to any situation
                            I find myself in.
